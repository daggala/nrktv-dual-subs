## Who is this extension for?

This extension is dedicated to new Norwegian language learners who want to expose themselves to new vocabulary and grammar. 

## How does this extension work?

This extension works by reading the native Norwegian subtitles on [https://tv.nrk.no](https://tv.nrk.no) and sending them to Google Translate to retrieve an equivalent translation in your selected language. Once translated, these new subtitles are displayed to the side of the existing Norwegian Subtitles. This entire process generally takes around 100-150ms on a modern network connection, so this process is not too obtrusive.
